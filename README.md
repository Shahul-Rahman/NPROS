NPROS is a suite of algorithms that is an elementary/easy-to-use, Random Optimization based global optimization algorithm. It is an improved/modified/elite version of the PROS (Pure Random Orthogonal Search) algorithm. The original PROS algorithm uses uniform distribution to sample new locations/points in the function domain, whereas our proposed NPROS suite uses Normal and Lognormal distribution. NPROS-1 smartly manipulates the mean and standard deviation parameters of the probability distribution to bring a flavour of 'Exploitation' to the otherwise purely explorative PROS search.

NPROS-2 is an RL based intelligent algorithm, which uses, a Multi-Armed Bandit and decaying epsilon strategy to learn and adopt the most suitable probability distribution automatically without any prior knowledge about the underlying objective function. NPROS-2 exhibits the possibility of incorporating RL strategies at an algorithmic level into optimization algorithms to make intelligent OP algorithms that can 'learn and adapt'.
